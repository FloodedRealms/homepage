						<h3> Who am I </h3>
						I am the illustrous author of the legendary Wavestone Keep. My online
						profile is either Flooded Realms or Shocktohp, I go by both interchangable.
						I am a programmer and avid ttrpg player. My tastes run in the OSR category
						of gaming, though I mostly play <a href="https://autarch.co/adventurer-conqueror-king/">ACKS</a>
						I write modules on occasion, and rant online more. Christ is king.

<div class="faq">
				<h3> Why does this site look like complete garbage? </h3>
				Because I am a big believer in the the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web.</a> There was
				a time before the walled gardens of social media, substack, and other conglomerated online services.
				This is a callback to that time. Anyone can have their own, personalized, landing site on the web.
				More interesting and more expressive than any facebook / twitter / mewe profile can ever be. Even
				more than the myspace of old. However, I am not a graphic design artist, I am a back-end developer.
				So that means that my site <i> looks </i> like it was designed by someone who should never be
				allowed to design anything. Because it was. However, this should give you hope! Anyone can have a
				webpage, and people should. It isn't a beauty contest. If you are interested in why I
				believe this and still use services like substack to blog, click <a href="faq.html">here</a>
