		<h3> Why do you Substack to blog? Aren't you some sort of tech hermit </h3>
		The simple answer is that substack makes my life easier. It has a functioning comment system. It exposes
		RSS feeds of blogs, so people can keep up without using substacks email notification system if they want to
		do so. The main downsides are the wyswyg editor and lack of control over my data. I solve both of this very
		simply: I write all my posts in markdown on my local machine (recently, I write them on both my local
		machine and my phone through <a href="https://obsidian.md">obsidian</a>). Then I paste the rendered markdown
		into their editor, add a button and post it. This means all my blog posts are mine, and even if substack
		goes down or bans me in the future, I can simply repost them elsewhere. Some of you may remember when I self
		hosted a blog here. That was using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> which solved a few problems. I
		considered wordpress, and decided against it because their editor is even more intrusive than Substack's.
		So, for now until someonre releases a markdown first blog hosting service, this is the workflow I am using.
